K-NCM (Knowledge Based NCM) aiming at support developers to describe, on multimedia dataset, representative features and relationships (hierarqui and merealogy) of concepts.
In  computer  vision scenarios, for example, given image pixels, the series of layers of the network can learn to extract visual features from it, the shallow layers can extract lower-level features (e.g.edges,  corner,  contours), while the deeper  combine  these features to produce higher-level features (e.g.textures, part of objects). 
These representative features can be clustered into groups, each one representing a specific concept.
